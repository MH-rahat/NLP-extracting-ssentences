"RYFF is a new company created by senior executives from within the entertainment industry. CEO Roy Taylor led the foundation of NVIDIA (NVDA) in Europe and previous to RYFF he was acting head of AMD (AMD) Studios in Hollywood.

Together they have developed a new process incorporating video game technology with photorealistic 3D models inserted into film and TV broadcast,  to disrupt the $23B branded entertainment industry.

Branded entertainment in movies &a; TV shows is currently a $23B globally ($10B USA) industry available only to major brands and growing at 17% CAGR.  Simultaneously, interstitial TV advertising is in decline whilst proliferating content (487 new scripted shows in 2017). This means a declining return on assets. At the same time, ad-skipping and ad-blocking are devastating traditional revenue models.

Remarkably, branded entertainment today is a manual process whereby products are delivered by hand to set. Additionally, simple adjustments in camera movement such as a pan left or right can obfuscate a brand requiring reshoots. Brands are also fixed in perpetuity and not able to be edited or updated. By introducing digital technology, we can bring branded entertainment into the modern world and disrupt incumbents creating a multibillion-dollar cutting edge business.

Consumers get a new option for content instead of pay a monthly subscription OR accept adverts they can get premium content for free accepting dynamic digital brand integration for brands they like. This is completely new and does not yet exist."
